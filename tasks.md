###Tasks
I would like to implement few issues in this code to check the debugging skills of the developer im interviewing:
1. some react hook that does not function properly and need to be identified and fixed
2. extra re-renders that can be identified from the screen itself
3. a complex cascade and specificity issue in css
4. css layout issue that require you to understand display and positioning 

let me know what you suggest
